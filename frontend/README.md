# Frontend (React Native + Expo)

## How to Start

1. Install dependencies:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

2. Start the project:
    ```sh
    npx expo start
    ```
    > If you use Expo Go on your phone, make sure your phone and computer are on the same Wi-Fi network.

3. Scan the QR code with the [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/client) app on your phone or use an emulator.

## Entry Point

- Main application file: **App.js**

## Notes

- When making requests to the backend, use the actual server IP address if testing on a physical device.
- You can install Expo CLI globally (`npm install -g expo-cli`), but it's recommended to use `npx` to run commands.
